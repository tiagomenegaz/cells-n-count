# Contact

This project consists in creating a solution to the problem described below using Matlab. This is an exercise developed during [CITS2401](http://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/units/unitdetails?code=CITS2401) in 2014.

>
(...) write a Matlab function file calledcontact.m that takes in as an input the X-Y position and radius of a collection of circles as a single (3xN or Nx3) variable. The function should output (in this order) (1) the total number of
overlapping circles (contacts), (2) the average number of contacts per circle and Note the input variable may be a 3xN or Nx3 array and so your function should A contact is defined as having occurred when the distance between the centres of
two circles is less than or equal to the sum of the two radii involved. Note there is Example data files are included (A_3xN.txt and A_Nx3.txt), with expected outputs, for checking your code. (...)"
